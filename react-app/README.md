# architecture-reconstruction

Project for Software Architecture where I try to recover a Module View of an existing Python project

### ReactJS tool

For visualisations, I am using a tool built by Northwoods Software for [GoJS 2.1](https://gojs.net). This project provides a basic example of using GoJS in a React app. Check out the [Intro page on using GoJS with React](https://gojs.net/latest/intro/react.html) for more information.
It makes use of the [gojs-react](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react) package to handle some boilerplate for setting up and tearing down a Diagram component.

## Installation

Start by running `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
