# architecture-reconstruction

Project for Software Architecture where I try to recover a Module View of an existing Python project

### Diagram tool

For visualisations, I am using a tool built by Northwoods Software for [GoJS 2.1](https://gojs.net).

## Installation

Start by running `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
